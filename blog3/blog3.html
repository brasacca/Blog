            <h2>Basic JavaScript to Make Static Website Interactive</h2>

            <p>JavaScript can be used along with HTML and CSS to make a website interactive. 
                JavaScript can be used for form validation, manipulation of CSS styles and many other
                things.
            </p>

            <p>
                Firtly, here is an example of how JavaScript can be used to suprise someone with a hidden
                message! In this example, when the user presses the button on screen, a special message will
                pop up telling them they are going on a cruise!
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is the HTML for this webpage, it has a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag which links to the 
                JavaScript file. In the body, there is a button that says "click here" that has a special attribute
                "onclick" with the value of a JavaScript method that will execute when the button is clicked. There is 
                also a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag with the id "hiddenMessage" and the style attribute making the text hidden.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="html-button.png">
            </figure>

            <p>
                Now, let's look at the JavaScript file. There is a function <code>revealMessage()</code>. It accesses the HTML 
                file with the variable <em>document</em> and uses the function <code>getElementById</code> which will search for 
                the HTML element with the ID "hiddenMessage". And then it changes that element's style to <code>display='block'</code> 
                which will override the initial value and will make the hidden image visible.
            </p>
