                <h2>Entry 2: Importance of Accessability in Web Development (9/9/2021)</h2>

                <p>Technology is meant to make people's lives easier, and in order to 
                maintain that precedent then those working in web development need to make
                sure that web sites are made accessible to everyone, regardless of physical
                or cognitive abilities. Examples of this include screen readers for those who
                are visually impaired, captions on videos for those who are have hearing impairments.
                Additionally, making your website accessable will also benefit others, including those 
                who use mobile devices or who have slow internet connection.
                </p>

                <p>There are many practices in HTMl, CSS and JavaScript that can provide accessability to 
                a web site. Here are a few examples:
                </p>

                <p>The <code>&ltabbr&gt</code> element that allows an abbreviation, acronym, or initialization to be 
                associated with its expansion
                </p>

                <p><code id = "abbr-ex">&ltp&gtWeb content is marked up using &ltabbr title="Hypertext Markup Language"&gtHTML&lt/abbr&gt.&lt/p&gt</code></p>

                <p id = "links">
                    How you display links on a web site is also an opportunity to boost your site's accessability.
                    There should be color variation between the standard link color, when the link has been visited,
                    and when the link is activated. Also, keyboard accessability is important for those who have physical
                    disabilities, so when navigating via tabbing, the link should have a border around it to indicate it is
                    being focused on.
                </p>
