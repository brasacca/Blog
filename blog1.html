                <h2>Entry 1: Importance of Semantic HTML (9/2/2021)</h2>

                <p>The concept of semantic HTML is an incredibly important
                    practice in web development that should not be overlooked.
                    An example used in an article I read referenced the <code>&ltp&gt</code> tag 
                    "This tag is semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs are
                    and browsers know how to display them"<a href='https://medium.com/adalab/the-importance-of-semantic-html-78e74fb75ff0' target='_blank'>
                    <sub>1</sub></a>. Alternativly, tags like <code>&ltb&gt</code> and <code>&lti&gt</code> are not, 
                    because they only definte the appearance of text rather than the context. This distinction is especially important 
                    when it comes to search engine optimization, as well as accessability so that screen readers know how to better interpret 
                    the text of a webpage. Also, more generally, sematics make your code cleaner and much easier
                    to maintain and read by yourself and other developers looking at your code.
                </p>

                <p>There are a plethora of tags that can be used to create cleaner, semantic HTML.
                    Take for example this piece of non-semantic HTML (click image for source)
                </p>
                
                <figure>
                    <a href='https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/semantic-html' target='_blank'><img src='/non-semantic.png' alt='non-semantic code'></a>
                </figure>

                <p>The three main tags that are used in semantic HTML are <code>&ltheader&gt, &ltmain&gt, and &ltfooter&gt.</code>
                    These tags are much more descriptive than simply using <code>&ltdiv&gt</code>
                    tags, like in the first code snippet. Here is the same code snippet modified using
                    semantic HTML.                    
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <a href='https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/semantic-html' target='_blank'><img src='/semantic.png' alt='semantic code'></a>
                </figure>

                <p>It's quiet easy to see how much cleaner the semantic HTML is in comparison to the non-semantic.
                    And, as previously stated it will increase the webpage's search engine optimization, as well as
                    increase accessability.
